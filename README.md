# Python barcode reader for Ubuntu.Banana Pi,PC
A simple barcode reader module for python on Ubuntu. It's made to call it from your program (instantiation needed to your main app), but it runs individually too for trying out the barcode reader.

Tested on Banana pi m3 and PC. 

Hopefully it works with any kind of USB 1D and 2D readers. Feel free to use it, i hope it helps!:) I am interested in your feedbacks, so please drop a comment!
